# Microsoft Go patches

The patches in this directory are applied to the `/go` submodule before building Microsoft Go.
This is done automatically by the build tools provided in `/eng`.

We use [`git-go-patch`](https://github.com/microsoft/go-infra/tree/main/cmd/git-go-patch) to maintain these patch files.

See [the `/eng` README](../eng/README.md) for more information.
