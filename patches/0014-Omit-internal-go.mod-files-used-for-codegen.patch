Subject: [PATCH] Omit internal go.mod files used for codegen

Rename the go.mod and go.sum files to no.mod and
no.sum. This makes Component Governance not scan
these go.mod files, preventing many false
positives for vulnerabilities in the dependencies
they contain.

Renaming the files before the build/tests can be
considered proof that they aren't used, which is
justification for ignoring them.

Rename rather than remove so that if a user needs
to modify our fork of Go in-situ and re-run these
parts of code generation, they can rename the
"no.*" files back to "go.*" because the content
isn't missing.

Alternatives:

There is no reason these files would be used when
using the Go toolset in a normal way, so directly
configuring Component Governance to ignore them
would be a reasonable alternative. However, as of
writing, there is no known way to do this.
See https://github.com/microsoft/go-lab/issues/76

Another alternative is to upgrade the dependencies
in these go.mod files to a newer version that
doesn't have vulnerabilities. However, deviating
from upstream Go may cause the output to be
different, so it could be misleading to our users.
Submitting upgrades directly upstream would avoid
this issue, but it would be hard to justify these
unnecessary upgrades.
