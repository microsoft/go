This directory, `/eng/doc`, contains documents describing the Microsoft
infrastructure used to build Go, in particular any designs that are not obvious
by reading the infrastructure code itself.

For dev scenario documentation, see [eng/README.md](/eng/README.md).

The [Downloads.md](Downloads.md) doc contains a table of links to the latest assets for each supported Go release branch.
The [release-branch-links.json](release-branch-links.json) file contains the same data in JSON format suitable for parsing.
