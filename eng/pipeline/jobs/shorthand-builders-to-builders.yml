# This template expands each "shorthand" builder in a list of builders into a builder object that
# includes its job ID. The list of builders is then passed into a given jobs template. This way, we
# don't need to repeat the ID evaluation template expression everywhere the value is needed.
#
# If any other builder-specific calculated value is needed based on shorthand properties, it can be
# added to this file. Passing data through a template like this one is the only way to share values
# to be used by template expressions, as of writing.
